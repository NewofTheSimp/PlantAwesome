                Our Story
                It all started with a simple idea: to craft beautiful, functional products from sustainable materials. What began as a small workshop in the heart of Portland, Oregon, has grown into a thriving business serving customers worldwide. Our founders, Jane Turner and Marcus Woods, were both passionate about the environment and design. They envisioned a brand that would challenge the fast-paced, disposable culture of today’s consumerism by offering thoughtfully designed, long-lasting products that respect the Earth.
